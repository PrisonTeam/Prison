#  New features have been recently added to prison.  These new features 
#  can add a lot of value to your server, but they may also be in the 
#  process of growing and evolving. If you experiance any issues, have
#  questions, or you have ideas on how to improve upon these items, 
#  then please visit our discord server.  These new features are 
#  marked with the "NEW" tag below.
#
#



# Enables Prison's debug mode as soon as prison starts.
# Do not enable unless instructed to do so, since it will increase the amount of
# information sent to the console.  To turn on/off debug mode, the following
# command will toggle it on and off:
#  /prison debug  
debug: false



# Prison support: 
#   Prison has a lot of built in tools to help us provide you with a higher degree of
#   support, and to help make it easier for you.
#   One of these features, is the ability to submit details about your server's
#   Prison setup so we can review many of the features and settings without having
#   to ask tons of questions. It also helps to improve the quality of our help by
#   eliminating miscommunication and trying to provide answers off of incorrect 
#   settings. 
#   Prison is able to gather various informmation and send it in one or more documents
#   and then provide you with one URL to copy and paste to share with us.
#   
#   submit-service:
#     PRIVATEBIN-NET - New default option - This uses an encrypted payload and no one

#
# These are various ranks settings:
#
# The setting `add-new-players-on-startup` will allow prison to scan for new players that
# have not been setup in prison, and add them at server startup.
# This can be disabled. If it is, then when new players are "accessed" then they should be
# added to prison upon demand.  It's been reported that adding new players can take a few
# seconds (2 to 5 seconds) per player, which has not been confirmed.  But if true, then
# existing servers switching over to Prison could take a long time to setup all players
# at startup. So this setting may make sense in those conditions.
# NOTE: Its not possible to test all situations where new players are bypassed when starting
#       Prison. Therefore disabling this setting is at your own risk. But if any issues are
#       encountered, then PLEASE contact support on our discord server ASAP and we will 
#       fix the issues for you. We want Prison to be bug free, but are not able to ensure
#       all functions able to handle new players that have not been added to Prison due to
#       the degree of complexity of some sections of prison.
#
# The 'player-economy-cache-update-delay-ticks' provides the nummber of ticks of a delay
# from when a player is paid money, until the prison updates the econommy.  The default
# delay is 3 seconds, or 60 tickks. The purpose of this delayed update is to prevent the
# frequent player payments while speed-mining fromm overwhelming the economy plugin. 
# For example, if there are 20 players online, all mining with a highly efficent pickaxe,
# and with autosell enabled, a single player would recieve payments for each block broken, 
# of which could quickly exceed 20 to 40 updates per second per player. So with 20 players
# mining concurrently, the econommy plugin would have to be able to handle 400, to 800 
# updates per second, if not more.  Some economy plugins cannot handle such loads, and
# can cause the server to lag becaus they are not using asynchronous updates to the storage
# of choice, and they mmay not cache the updates to prevent so many updates.
# If the 3 second delay is too long, and you're wanting something a little quicker, try
# reducing the number of ticks to like 30, 20, or 10.  Becareful of going too low.  If 
# you notice potential server deplays, trying incrasing the delays. You can use
# `/timings` to confirm where the lag is occuring.

# WARNING: Never use the following setting to disable the vault-economy
#   integration unless directed by Prison support to do so.
# WARNING: Prison will not allow the Ranks module to be enabled if a valid
#   economy cannot be found and enabled succesfully.  Use of this setting 
#   may prevent prison from finding a workable economy to use.
# This setting, integrations.prevent-economy-vault-usage, will prevent
# the use of vault for any economy transactions. Prison primarily uses vault, 
# so enabling this setting could be dangerous. 
# Where it can be useful, is if prison cannot communicate through vault, 
# but is able to successfully communicate directly with the 
# EssentialsEconomy, SaneEconomy, TheNewEconomy, or GemsEconomy.  Enabling this setting
# will NOT work for any other plugins.
# To test vault, run the following commands when vault economy has been
# succesfully loaded.  Run these command in the console:
#   /balance <player>
#   /ranks player <player>
# Compare the total balance for the specified player from both commands.
# They should match. If not, then there is an issue with vault.
# Please contact the Prison support team through our discord server.

# Default language that is used as the primary language.

# language files that can be edited.
default-language: en_US



# Prison defaults to a location code of en_US for the formatting of numbers 
# which uses a "." for the decimal position, and "," for the thousands separator.
# Prison overries the use of the server's and Java's location code, for the
# exclusive purpose of formatting numbers, of which may not be
# controllable by admins if they are using a hosted server. 
# This allows separation between the default_language codes and the
# number formatting language code.
# The problem with using some other locations, such as en_UK, is that they
# may use a Non-Blanking SPace (NBSP) for the thousands separator, of which
# Minecraft cannot display that uni-code correctly and shows it as a 
# squre with the letters NB on the first line, and SP on the second.
# Examples of number formatting patterns and the results: 
#       #,##0  and  #,##0.000 
#       1,000  and  1,000.123
# This controls number formatting of the symbols used throughout all of

# Prison mines reset gap is the number of milliseconds that are used to 
# space out the mine resets when starting the server.  This value should 
# not be changed unless you understand what you are doing. This value
# is converted to ticks, so should use 50 millisecond increments. If too 
# small of a value is used then it could produce a large amount of lag 
# if more than one mine tries to reset at the same time, or close to each
# other.  This may be changed to ticks in the near future.

# Warning: Do not use the following option. This could break the natural Bukkit 
# loading behavior of Prison and other plugins.  It can have unexpected 
# side effects. 
# Use this feature ONLY when instructed by Prison support team and when 
# other solutions have be tried first.
#
#   CMI Economy, through Vault, can have an issue of not initializing itself until 
# all other plugins are done starting up, which means it's not active when prison 
# tries to start.  Prison must enable it's integration with Vault before
# it can enable Ranks, and everything that is depending upon ranks.  Failure to
# have a funcional Economy when Ranks are enabled could lead to runtime errors
# and even data corruption within your server, so ranks are disabled under those
# conditons.
#
#   To get CMI's economy working with Prison, this option wil test to see if the Vault 
# Economy is active, if it is, then it will allow Prison to start normally.  If not,
# it will allow the prison's onEnable() function to return with a "success" to tell
# Bukkit/Spigot that Prison was enabled successfully, but in reality, the 
# enabling of Prison will be delayed for 5 seconds and then it will try again.
# If it is, then Prison will be enabled.  If the Vault Economy is still not
# active, then it will try again in 5 seconds.  It will attempt to start 6
# times and if it fails to find an active Vault Economy then Prison will 
# NOT start up at all.
#
#   It's an all or nothing situation when you enable this feature.
#
# It's been reported that the correct value to use for CMI is: Economy_CMI
# Vault may report CMIEconomy but that is wrong.
#
# Warning: Other plugins that depend upon and use Prison may fail.  If they do fail 
# because of a delayed start, then that is beyond the scope of support that can
# be provided by Prison.  Delayed start is provided to get CMI working.  
# We cannot be responsible for their choices.   
#
# Note: The process that this controls ONLY checks for the activation of Vault
# Economy.  Therefore you must use CMI with Vault. Also this will "work" with 
# any other economy plugins using vault too.  But please do not use this 
# unless all other options have been exhusted. 
#
# NOTE: Due to the high degree of CMI Economies forcing the use of this delayed 
# start, if delayed start is disabled and if Prison detects that CMI is enabled, 
# Prison will now force a delayed start with the any vault economy being the
# target.  This means as long as vault has an active economy, then prison will
# start.  IF the vault economy is found right away, then no dealy startup will 
# be submitted, and normal startup will continue right away.
# 
# To use the delayed startup:
# 1. delayedPrisonStartup.enabled: true
# 2. Optional: cooldown-secs and max-attemps identifies how frequently and how
#    many times Prison will try to hook in to the vault economy.
# 3. inspect-vault is optional. When enabled it will display what value must be
#    used with the vault-economy-name.
# 4. triggers.vault: true.  Must be true or this won't work. When true this
#    ensures Vault has been registered and is also enabled.
# 5. vault-economy-name: must match what's in vault.  If not, then prison will 
#    fail to start.

# The prisonCommandHander allows you to fine tune the Prison Command Handler
# by adding aliases for any command, prevent non-op players from using specific
# commands, viewing the command's' help, or list the blocked commands. 
#
# Commands must be listed in a hierarchy format. For example the command
# `/mines tp` must be listed under the appropreiate sections as:
#    mines:
#      tp:
#
# For the exclude-non-ops there is a global setting that will apply the
# restriction to specified command, plus their aliases.  If set to false,
# then each alias would have to be listed for them to be excluded.
#
# For each exclude-non-ops entry, you can specify the includeCmdPerms and
# the includeCmdAltPerms, both of which defaults to false.  You would have
# to explicity enable them to prevent them from applying; use a value of true.
#
# For the includeCmdPerms, all perms included in the command are tested for
# each player, and if there is a hit then the command is excluded for that player.
# For the includeCmdAltPerms all are tested too, but no translations are
# applied so most may not produce any hits.
# The listed perms for each command are tested as is, with no translations.
# If the given player has a hit on the perm, then they are excluded from 
# being able to use the command.
#
# OPs, including console, are bypassed and cannot be excluded from any command.

# Hesitancy Delay Penalty - The purpose of the Hesitancy Delay Penalty is to encourage players
# to rankup to the next rank.  Once a player exceeds the rankup cost, they start to incurr a 
# rankup penalty.  The penalty would be based upon the amount over the rankup cost.  So if a player
# has 1.1 million, then only 0.1 million will be subject to the penalty and the penalty will be 20%.
# The max value a player can achieve for a rank will be the rankup cost, then the Hesitancy 
# Delay Penalty will be subtracted from that amount. 
# For example, if the rankup cost would be 1.0 million and a player has 1.1 million, then their 
# max "score" they can achieve is 1.0 million, but the 20% penalty on the 0.1 million will be 
# subtracted from the "score".  So their adjusted score would be:
#   1.0 million - 0.1 million * 0.2 = 1.0 m - 20,000 = 0.8 m

# Player-Cache: The player cache stores and tracks a lot of detailed information for
# all players. There are a few settings that can help improve performance, or help 
# adjust for your server's requiremments.
# write-delay-sec: Default 60 seconds - There is a player cache task that runs every 
#                  x seconds, based upon this setting. It maintains the cache by 
#                  saving 'dirty' entries, purging entries that have expired (off-line
#                  player cache entries that have been loaded for longer than the 
#                  time to live value). etc... This task provides the house keeping 
#                  functions, with the most critical aspect being saving changed cached
#                  entries.  This value need to be carefully balanced to help ensure the
#                  entries are save frequently to protect against loss if the server 
#                  crashes, but also it should be long enough so it does not consume
#                  too many resources.
#                  One minute may be a good starting point, but on stable servers, you 
#                  could push it back to about 5 mins, 15 mins, or longer.
#                  When the server shuts down normally, all dirty entries in the cache
#                  are tried to be written before the server process is hard-terminated,
#                  so consideration need to be applied to how many changes can be saved 
#                  before the server gives up and hard-terminates the saves, which could
#                  result in lost data.
# time-to-live-sec: Default 30 mins.  For off line players, if there have been no 
#                   interactions, or usage of their cache entries, they will be purged
#                   from the cache.  This may also apply to online players too, but 
#                   they would have to inactive for this duration.  If a player is 
#                   purged from cache, then they will be reloaded when the rejoin the
#                   server, or there is a need to update, or access their cache entry.
# update-player-stats-sec: Default 30 seconds.  Checks to see if all players within the
#                          player cache who are marked as active are still online.
#                          This does not update any files and does not interact with 
#                          bukkit/spigot. Very, very minimal impact on server, but
#                          important to recording player's activity level on the server.
