================================
You are building Prison.

Note that you are probably using
a development build and therefore
a buggy build. Don't use it on a
production server unless you know
what you are doing! You have been
WARNED.

Output files will be in
[subproject]/build/libs.
The runnable JAR is usually
named Prison[ModuleName].jar.
