# NOTE: A messages__version is an arbitrary integer that will be manually incremented within Prison
#       when there are changes to these messages.  This value represents when message content is 
#       changed, fixed, or added to. This value may not be increased if the change is very small and 
#       insignificant, such as a space or a couple of letters.
#
#       messages__auto_refresh=true indicates that this file will automatically be replaced if 
#       Prison detects a messages__version difference.  The old file will be deleted (renamed) and
#       a new copy will be placed in the directory to be used. If this value is set to false, then
#       Prison will not refresh this file and there could be issues with the display of other messages.
#       If auto refresh is set to false, we are not held responsible for possible issues that can 
#       arise from inaccurate messages.  If set to false, then you are responsible for maintaining
#       the messages on your own.
#
#       If you make changes to this file, and you have messages__auto_refresh=false, then those 
#       changes will be replaced when this file is updated.  Since the old file is renamed, and 
#       not deleted, you can manually merge your changes back in to the new update.  The old
#       renamed files will never be deleted by prison; you can remove them when you feel like it
#       is safe to do so.
#
# Please consider helping Prison, and everyone else who may use Prison, by contributing all
# translations to other languages.  They should be faithful translations, and not something 
# for the sake of humor or changes just for cosmetic styling.  If you have something you would
# like to share, please contact a staff member on our Discord server.  
#Thanks for your contributions!

##
## Prison Supports Unicode (UTF-8) encoding in these properties files.  BUt you must
## follow these instructions to ensure everything works properly.
##
## 1. You should only edit these files using a UTF-8 editor.  On windows use NotePad, not WordPad.
##    WordPad will save as plain text.  To confirm the save was successful: save, close the editor, 
##    then reopen to confirm the encoding was preserved.
##
## 2. When running on Windows, you must enable utf-8 encoding in minecraft's console.  Windows
##    defaults to a characterpage 1252.  To enable window's use of utf-8, you need to change the
##    encoding prior to launching spigot/paper:
##    chcp 65001
##
## Full example of a windows script, which hooks for java debugging:
##  rem Note: chcp 65001 enables utf-8 in windows, when normally windows uses characterpage 1252
##  chcp 65001
##  java -Dfile.encoding="UTF-8" -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005 -Xms1g -Xmx4g -jar spigot-1.8.8.jar nogui --log-strip-color
##  pause
##
## 3. When viewing the logs/latest.log files you must use an editor such as NotePad instead of WordPad.
##
## 4. Unicode is properly displayed in game, in console, in the logs, and with paste.helpch.at when using
##    /prison support submit.
